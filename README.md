# Blank's Theme Reborn

**Back from the dead.** This is a complete overhaul of the original Blank's Theme released a year ago.

The goal is simple: **Maximum distinction.**
I've tuned the colors to make sure you can instantly tell the difference between variables, functions, and keywords without guessing. No visual noise, just clean syntax highlighting.

## What's New?

* Refined color palette for better contrast.
* Updated support for modern VS Code syntax.
* Cleaner UI borders.
